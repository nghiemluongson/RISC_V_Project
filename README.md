# RISC_V_Project
Personal Project

## Description
This project involves building a simple CPU based on the RISC-V architecture using Verilog. The design includes key components such as the Program Counter, ALU, Register File, Control Unit, and Memory modules. It aims to simulate basic instruction execution and provide hands-on experience in digital design and computer architecture.

## Objectives
1. Understand the fundamentals of the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
2. Design and implement a simple CPU datapath using Verilog.
3. Simulate and verify each component module (e.g., ALU, Register File, Control Unit).
4. Integrate all modules to execute basic RISC-V instructions.
5. Gain practical experience in hardware design and digital system simulation.
6. Prepare a functional testbench to validate the entire CPU design.

## RISC-V Architecture
1. RISC-V is an open-standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). It is designed to be simple, modular, and extensible, making it ideal for both academic research and commercial applications.
2. RISC-V is a free and open ISA that allows developers to build custom processors without licensing restrictions. Its modular design enables scalable CPU implementations, from simple microcontrollers to powerful out-of-order processors.
